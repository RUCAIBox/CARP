Specifically, we have $$(x+650)^2 = x^2 + 1300x + 650^2,$$so \\begin{align*}\nx^2+1300x+1300 &= (x+650)^2 - 650^2 + 1300 \\\\\n&= (x+650)^2 - 650\\cdot 650 + 2\\cdot 650 \\\\\n&= (x+650)^2 + (-650+2)\\cdot 650 \\\\\n&= (x+650)^2 + (-648)(650).\n\\end{align*}This has the target form $(x+b)^2+c$, where $b=650$ and $c=(-648)(650)$.

Find $a+b+c$.", "steps": "Consider the expression $P(a) = (a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$ as a polynomial in $a$. It follows that $P(-b) = (b -b + c)^3 - (-b)^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 0$, so $a+b$ is a factor of the polynomial $P(a)$. By symmetry, $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$ divides into the expression $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$; as both expressions are of degree $3$ in their variables, it follows that $$(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = k(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 150 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5,$$ where we can determine that $k = 3$ by examining what the expansion of $(a+b+c)^3$ will look like. Since $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a+b$, $b+c$, and $c+a$ must all be greater than $1$, so it follows that $\\{a+b, b+c, c+a\\} = \\{2,5,5\\}$. Summing all three, we obtain that $$(a+b) + (b+c) + (c+a) = 2(a+b+c) = 2 + 5 + 5 = 12,$$ so $a+b+c = \\boxed{6}$.", "answer": "6"}
