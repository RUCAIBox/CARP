Question:
$$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:   (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$

Given Solution:
Since $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, the midpoint of $\\overline{P Q}$ is the center of the circle. The midpoint of $\\overline{P Q}$ is $\\left(\\frac{10+6}{2},\\frac{-5-5}{2}\\right)=(8,-5)$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $(8,-5)$. Since the radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{16}=4$, any point on the circle is 4 units away from the center. To find the coordinates of $Q$, we can move 4 units to the left from the center to get $(8-4,-5)=(4,-5)$. Therefore, the coordinates of $Q$ are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } (2,-5)}$.

Verification:
Action: think("The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius")
Output: According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. 
Action: think("Point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle")
Output: The center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. 
Action: solve_multi_eq(["\frac{x+10}{2}=6", "\frac{y+(-5)}{2}=-5"])
Output: {"x": ["x = 2"], "y": ["y = - 5"]}
Final Answer: A

The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle. The answer is: A

Question:
Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue? (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980

Given Solution:
Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, the length of the Great Sphinx statue in palms is $140 \\text{ cubits} \\times 7 \\text{ palms/cubit} = 980$ palms. Therefore, the best approximation for the length of the Great Sphinx statue in palms is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }980}$.

Verification:
Action: calculate("140 * 7")

Question:
The expression $\frac{x^{-2} y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following? (A)$\frac{\sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\frac{y \sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\frac{y \sqrt{y}}{x \sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\frac{y \sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \sqrt[3]{x}}$

Given Solution:
Using the laws of exponents, we can simplify the expression as follows: $$\frac{x^{-2} y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}=x^{-2-\frac{1}{3}} y^{\frac{1}{2}+1}=x^{-\frac{7}{3}} y^{\frac{3}{2}}$$ Now, we can rewrite this expression using only positive exponents: $$x^{-\frac{7}{3}} y^{\frac{3}{2}}=\frac{y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{7}{3}}}=\frac{\sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{7}}}$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{\sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}}$.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.

Question:
Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts? (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero

Given Solution:
For a function to have an $x$-intercept, the $y$-value must be zero at some point. Therefore, to have no $x$-intercepts, the function must never equal zero. Choice $A$ is incorrect because a linear function with a nonzero rate of change will eventually cross the $x$-axis. Choice $B$ is incorrect because a quadratic function with real zeros will have $x$-intercepts. Choice $C$ is correct because a quadratic function with no real zeros will never cross the $x$-axis. Choice $D$ is incorrect because a cubic polynomial with at least one real zero will have an $x$-intercept. The answer is: C.

Verification:
Action: think("If $f$ is a function of $x$")
Output: Then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$.
Action: think("An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$")
Output: Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros
Action: think("Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts")
Output: Choice $A$ is incorrect
Action: think("The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope")
Output: The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. 
Action: think("The graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph")
Output: The graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept, so Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect
