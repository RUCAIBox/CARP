Question: $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?
Choose from the following options:   (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$
Trial: Since $\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, the midpoint of $\overline{P Q}$ is the center of the circle. The midpoint of $\overline{P Q}$ is $\left(\frac{10+6}{2},\frac{-5-5}{2}\right)=(8,-5)$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $(8,-5)$. Since the radius of the circle is $\sqrt{16}=4$, any point on the circle is 4 units away from the center. To find the coordinates of $Q$, we can move 4 units to the left from the center to get $(8-4,-5)=(4,-5)$. Therefore, the coordinates of $Q$ are $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } (2,-5)}$.
//
Action: think("The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius")
//
Output: According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. 
//
Action: think("Point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle")
//
Output: The center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. 
//
Action: solve_multi_eq(["\frac{x+10}{2}=6", "\frac{y+(-5)}{2}=-5"])
//
Output: {"x": ["x = 2"], "y": ["y = - 5"]}

Question: Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?
Choose from the following options:   (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980
Trial: Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, the length of the Great Sphinx statue in palms is $140 \text{ cubits} \times 7 \text{ palms/cubit} = 980$ palms. Therefore, the best approximation for the length of the Great Sphinx statue in palms is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }980}$.
//
Action: calculate("140 * 7")
//
Output: 980

Question: In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)
Choose from the following options:   (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75
Trial: The increase in distance is approximately $42-40=2$ kilometers. Converting to miles, we have $2/1.6=1.25$ miles. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 1.25}$.
//
Action: calculate("2 / 1.6")
//
Output: 1.25

Final Answer: B

Question: The expression $\frac{x^{-2} y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?
Choose from the following options:   (A)$\frac{\sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\frac{y \sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\frac{y \sqrt{y}}{x \sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\frac{y \sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \sqrt[3]{x}}$
Trial: Using the laws of exponents, we can simplify the expression as follows: $$\frac{x^{-2} y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}=x^{-2-\frac{1}{3}} y^{\frac{1}{2}+1}=x^{-\frac{7}{3}} y^{\frac{3}{2}}$$ Now, we can rewrite this expression using only positive exponents: $$x^{-\frac{7}{3}} y^{\frac{3}{2}}=\frac{y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{7}{3}}}=\frac{\sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{7}}}$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{\sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}}$.
//
Action: is_equal("\frac{x^{-2} y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}", "\frac{\sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}")
//
Output: False
//
Action: is_equal("\frac{x^{-2} y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}", "\frac{y \sqrt{y}}{\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}")
//
Output: False
//
Action: is_equal("\frac{x^{-2} y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}", "\frac{y \sqrt{y}}{x \sqrt{x}}")

Output: False
//
Action: is_equal("\frac{x^{-2} y^{\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}", "\frac{y \sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \sqrt[3]{x}}")

Question: Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?
Choose from the following options:   (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero
Trial: For a function to have an $x$-intercept, the $y$-value must be zero at some point. Therefore, to have no $x$-intercepts, the function must never equal zero. Choice $A$ is incorrect because a linear function with a nonzero rate of change will eventually cross the $x$-axis. Choice $B$ is incorrect because a quadratic function with real zeros will have $x$-intercepts. Choice $C$ is correct because a quadratic function with no real zeros will never cross the $x$-axis. Choice $D$ is incorrect because a cubic polynomial with at least one real zero will have an $x$-intercept. The answer is: C.
//
Action: think("If $f$ is a function of $x$")
//
Output: Then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$.
//
Action: think("An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$")
//
Output: Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros
//
Action: think("Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts")
//
Output: Choice $A$ is incorrect
//
Action: think("The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope")
//
Output: The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. 
//
Action: think("The graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph")
//
Output: The graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept, so Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect
//
Final Answer: C
