Question: The quadratic $x^2+1300x+1300$ can be written in the form $(x+b)^2+c$, where $b$ and $c$ are constants. What is $\frac{c}{b}$
Trial: We complete the square.\n\nSince the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, we know that $(x+b)^2+c$ has the same leading coefficient. Expanding $(x+b)^2+c$ gives $x^2+2bx+b^2+c$, so we must have $b^2+c=1300$.\n\nTo find $b$, we note that $(x+b)^2$ has a linear term of $2bx$, so we must have $2b=1300$, which gives $b=650$.\n\nThen $\frac{c}{b}=\frac{1300-b^2}{b}=\frac{1300-650^2}{650}=-649$, so $\frac{c}{b}=\boxed{-649}$. The answer is: -649

Output: ( x + 650 ) ^ { 2 } - 421200

Question: What is the value of $x$ in the equation $16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}=2^x$?
Trial: Simplify the left-hand side of the equation as $4\cdot 16^{16}=4\cdot (2^4)^{16}=4\cdot 2^{64}$.  Therefore, $4\cdot 16^{16}=2^{66}$, so $x=\boxed{66}$. The answer is: 66
//
Action: solve_eq("16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}=2^x")

Question: Evaluate $\left\lceil\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\frac{9}{4}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2\right\rceil$.
Trial: We have $\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}=\frac{3}{2}$, so the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\frac{3}{2}$ is $2$. We also have $\frac{9}{4}=2\frac{1}{4}$, so the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\frac{9}{4}$ is $3$. Finally, $\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2=\frac{81}{16}$, and since $\frac{64}{16}=4<\frac{81}{16}<\frac{100}{16}=6\frac{1}{4}$, the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2$ is $5$. Therefore, the sum is $2+3+5=\boxed{10}$. The answer is: 10

Question: Suppose that $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers satisfying $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 150$. Find $a+b+c$.
Trial: Consider the expression $P(a) = (a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$ as a polynomial in $a$. It follows that $P(-b) = (b -b + c)^3 - (-b)^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 0$, so $a+b$ is a factor of the polynomial $P(a)$. By symmetry, $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$ divides into the expression $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$; as both expressions are of degree $3$ in their variables, it follows that $$(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = k(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 150 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5,$$ where we can determine that $k = 3$ by examining what the expansion of $(a+b+c)^3$ will look like. Since $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a+b$, $b+c$, and $c+a$ must all be greater than $1$, so it follows that $\{a+b, b+c, c+a\} = \{2,5,5\}$. Summing all three, we obtain that $$(a+b) + (b+c) + (c+a) = 2(a+b+c) = 2 + 5 + 5 = 12. The answer is: 12

Question: Berengere and her American foreign-exchange student Emily are at a bakery in Paris that accepts both euros and American dollars. They want to buy a cake, but neither of them has enough money. If the cake costs 6 euros and Emily has an American five-dollar bill, how many euros does Berengere need to contribute to the cost of the cake if 1 euro = 1.25 USD?
Trial: Since 1 euro is worth 1.25 dollars, 6 euros is worth $6 \cdot 1.25 = 7.50$ dollars. Since Emily has a five-dollar bill, she needs $7.50 - 5 = 2.50$ dollars more. Since 1 euro is worth 1.25 dollars, Berengere needs to contribute $\frac{2.50}{1.25} = \boxed{2}$ euros. The answer is: 2 euros.
//
Action: think("Convert Emily's 5 USD money into euros")
//
Output: Emily's five-dollar bill is equivalent to 5\times\frac{1}{1.25}
//
Action: calculate("5 \times \frac { 1 } { 1.25 }")
//
Output: 4

Action: think("The girls need 6 euros between them")
//
Output: Berengere must contribute $6-4$
