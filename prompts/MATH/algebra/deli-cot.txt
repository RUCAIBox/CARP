Question:
The quadratic $x^2+1300x+1300$ can be written in the form $(x+b)^2+c$, where $b$ and $c$ are constants. What is $\frac{c}{b}$

Given Solution:
We complete the square.

Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, we know that $(x+b)^2+c$ has the same leading coefficient. Expanding $(x+b)^2+c$ gives $x^2+2bx+b^2+c$, so we must have $b^2+c=1300$.

To find $b$, we note that $(x+b)^2$ has a linear term of $2bx$, so we must have $2b=1300$, which gives $b=650$.

Then $\frac{c}{b}=\frac{1300-b^2}{b}=\frac{1300-650^2}{650}=-649$, so $\frac{c}{b}=\boxed{-649}$. The answer is: -649

Verification:
Action: complete_the_square("x^2+1300x+1300")
Output: ( x + 650 ) ^ { 2 } - 421200
Action: think("Compare $(x+b)^2+c$ with $(x+650)^2-421200$ to get b and c")
Output: $b=650$ and $c=-421200$
Action: substitute("\frac{c}{b}", ["b = 650", "c = -421200"])
Output: - 648
Final Answer: -648

The square whose non-constant terms agree with $x^2+1300x+1300$ is $(x+650)^2$. Comparing $(x+b)^2+c$ with $(x + 650) ^ 2$, we can see that $b = 650$. Expanding $(x + 650) ^ 2$ gives us $x ^ { 2 } + 1300 x + 422500$. Comparing $(x+b)^2+c$ with $x^2+1300x+1300$ according to $x ^ { 2 } + 1300 x + 422500$ gives us $x ^ 2 + 1300x + 1300 = (x + 650) ^ 2 - 422500 + 1300$. Calculating $- 422500 + 1300$ gives us $- 421200$. Substituting this result with the contextual conditions of $b = 650$ and $c = -421200$ into $\frac{c}{b}$ gives us the result of $- 648$. The answer is: -648

Question:
What is the value of $x$ in the equation $16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}=2^x$?

Given Solution:
Simplify the left-hand side of the equation as $4\cdot 16^{16}=4\cdot (2^4)^{16}=4\cdot 2^{64}$.  Therefore, $4\cdot 16^{16}=2^{66}$, so $x=\boxed{66}$. The answer is: 66

Verification:
Action: solve_eq("16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}+16^{16}=2^x")
Output: ["x = 66"]
Final Answer: 66

Question:
Given $\delta(x) = 3x + 8$ and $\phi(x) = 8x + 7$, what is $x$ if $\delta(\phi(x)) = 7$?

Given Solution:
We can see that $\delta(\phi(x)) = 3(8x + 7) + 8 = 24x + 29.$ Therefore, we have that $24x + 29 = 7$, giving us $24x = -22.$ Therefore, $x = \boxed{-\dfrac{11}{13}}.$ The answer is: -\dfrac{11}{13}

Verification:
Action: substitute("3x+8", ["x=8x+7"])
Output: - \frac { 11 } { 12 }
Final Answer: - \frac { 11 } { 12 }

Revise the given solution based on the verification process:
//
We can substitute the function phi into the function delta to get: $3(8x+7)+8=24x+29$, then we can solve the equation to get the final answer $x=-\frac{11}{12}$. The answer is: x=-\frac{11}{12}

Question:
Evaluate $\left\lceil\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\frac{9}{4}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2\right\rceil$.

Given Solution:
We have $\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}=\frac{3}{2}$, so the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\frac{3}{2}$ is $2$. We also have $\frac{9}{4}=2\frac{1}{4}$, so the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\frac{9}{4}$ is $3$. Finally, $\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2=\frac{81}{16}$, and since $\frac{64}{16}=4<\frac{81}{16}<\frac{100}{16}=6\frac{1}{4}$, the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2$ is $5$. Therefore, the sum is $2+3+5=\boxed{10}$. The answer is: 10

Verification:
Action: calculate("\left\lceil\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\frac{9}{4}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2\right\rceil")

Question:
Berengere and her American foreign-exchange student Emily are at a bakery in Paris that accepts both euros and American dollars. They want to buy a cake, but neither of them has enough money. If the cake costs 6 euros and Emily has an American five-dollar bill, how many euros does Berengere need to contribute to the cost of the cake if 1 euro = 1.25 USD?

Given Solution:
Since 1 euro is worth 1.25 dollars, 6 euros is worth $6 \cdot 1.25 = 7.50$ dollars. Since Emily has a five-dollar bill, she needs $7.50 - 5 = 2.50$ dollars more. Since 1 euro is worth 1.25 dollars, Berengere needs to contribute $\frac{2.50}{1.25} = \boxed{2}$ euros. The answer is: 2 euros.

Verification:
Action: think("Convert Emily's 5 USD money into euros")
Output: Emily's five-dollar bill is equivalent to 5\times\frac{1}{1.25}
Action: calculate("5 \times \frac { 1 } { 1.25 }")
Output: 4
Action: think("The girls need 6 euros between them")
Output: Berengere must contribute $6-4$
Action: calculate("6 - 4")
Output: 2

Emily's 5 USD money is converted into euros using the exchange rate of 1.25 USD for 1 euro. The calculation is done in two steps: first, 5 USD is multiplied by 1/1.25 to get 4 euros; second, 6 euros is subtracted from 4 euros to get 2 euros. Therefore, the final answer is 2 euros. The answer is: 2
