# CARP
This repo provides the CARP dataset and the source code & data of our paper: `Evaluating and Improving Tool-Augmented Computation-Intensive Math Reasoning`.

## The CARP Dataset
The **CARP** dataset consists of 4,886 middle school computation-intensive algebra problems, and each problem is associated with a natural language solution and an annotated EFG.
Our annotated EFG explicitly depicts the step-by-step reasoning process of a math problem in a readable and concise format.

The CARP dataset and other datasets evaluated in the paper are stored in [`data`](https://github.com/ToheartZhang/CARP/blob/main/data) directory. 

## Two-Stage Deliberation
The code will be released as soon as possible.
